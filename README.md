# Morph 4K – Metal Game Solid Presets

This repository contains **custom Morph 4K presets** created and maintained by **Metal Game Solid**.

Our goal with this project is to share carefully tuned presets that enhance classic game visuals while respecting the original look and intent. These presets are tested with real hardware use cases in mind and are designed for enthusiasts who care about image quality, consistency, and authenticity.

## Important note

We are still actively **experimenting with the Morph 4K**.

These presets are part of an ongoing learning and testing process.  
Mistakes can happen, settings may change, and not every preset will be perfect for every setup. We do **not** claim these presets are definitive or flawless, they are shared in the spirit of experimentation, community feedback, and continuous improvement.

If something looks off, behaves unexpectedly, or could be improved, feedback is always welcome.
